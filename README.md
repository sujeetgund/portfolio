## Portfolio Website For Developers 💯


Portfolio for developers is a simple and minimalistic website to showcase your skills and projects as a developer. The design is inspired by [Manu Arora](https://manuarora.in/). The website is completely Open Source, you can use it for whatever purpose you want.
